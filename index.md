## About Me

I am in my second PhD year in University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), advised by [Prof. Lei Li](https://lileicc.github.io/).
Before that, I was a full-time researcher of ByteDance AI Lab and closely worked with [Jiaze Chen](https://cn.linkedin.com/in/jiaze-chen-00ab2681) and [Hao Zhou](https://zhouh.github.io/).
I obtained my Master and Bachelor degrees in Computer Science from Fudan University. I was a member of [Fudan NLP Group](https://nlp.fudan.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Xipeng Qiu](https://xpqiu.github.io/en.html) and [Prof. Xuanjing Huang](https://nlp.fudan.edu.cn/28702/list.htm).
My research focuses on **Natural Language Processing**, especially generative AI. I am also interested in **AI methods for drug discovery**.
